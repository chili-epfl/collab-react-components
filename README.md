## Installation
- Requires React 15.4.0+.
- Requires "react-jsonschema-form" npm package.
> Note: The "master" branch of the repository reflects the published stable release.

```
$ npm install --save collab-web-forms
```

> Note: It is recommended to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
with this package for better rendering of the form elements.

## Server initialization
In order to use the collaborative functionalities, you will need to start a new
CollabServer instance. One way to do it is on startup:

```JavaScript
const CollabServer = require('collab-web-forms').Server;

// app is you Express app for example.

CollabServer.start(app);
```
You can also stop the server by calling:

```JavaScript
CollabServer.stop();
```
> Note: See the demos for an example of implementation with an
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.
## Usage
For a basic implementation, see the demos applications.

### Simple Collaborative Editor

To implement a simple collaborative editor (textarea), start by instantiating
a new `CollabModel.js` on the server, taking as parameter the name of the collaborative collection:

```JavaScript
const CollabModel = require('collab-web-forms').Model;

const model = new CollabModel("documents");
model.create("myEditor");
```

#### Server API

- `create(id, data = '')`: Creates a new document with `id` and with initial `data` (String).
- `remove(id)`: Deletes a document with ID `id`.

#### Client API

Call `CollabEditor` from the client

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { CollabEditor } from 'collab-web-forms/dist/client';

render((
  <CollabEditor
    id="myEditor"
    collectionName="documents"
  />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```
Props of `CollabEditor`:
- `id*`: ID of the document to fetch from the database
- `collectionName*`: Name of the collection
- `rows`: "rows" attribute of the textarea
- `classNames`: default is `form-control`
- `onChange`: Function called on every local modification. Returns the current value of the editor.

### Collaborative Form
>Note: The collaborative form is based on [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)

To implement a collaborative form, start by instantiating a new `CollabModel` on the server,
taking as parameter the name of the collection and a schema:

```JavaScript
const CollabModel = require('collab-web-forms').Model;

const model = new CollabModel("forms");
const schema = {
      title: "My collaborative form",
      type: "object",
      required: ["input", "textarea"],
      properties: {
        input: {type: "string", title: "Input"},
        textarea: {type: "string", title: "Textarea", default: 'Default text'},
      }
    };
model.createForm("myForm", schema);
```
This will create a new collaborative document on the database containing the
collaborative data of the form.

#### Server API

- `createForm(id, schema)`: Creates a new document with `id` and with initial data corresponding to the `schema`.
- `remove(id)`: Deletes a form with ID `id`.

#### Client API

Just call `CollabForm` from the client.

> Note: You shouldn't use the widget `password` in a collaborative form.
At least not until the data is crypted on the database.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { CollabForm } from 'collab-web-forms/dist/client';

render((
  <CollabForm
    id="MyForm"
    collectionName="forms"
  />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```
> Note: `CollabForm` can be used exactly like `Form` from `react-jsonschema-form`
with few exceptions (see below).


Props of `CollabForm` that vary from `react-jsonschema-form`:
- `id`: ID of the form to fetch from the database
- `collectionName`: Name of the collection

You should not pass a `schema` to the `CollabForm` component.

The supported collaborative String types are `text`, `textarea` and `uri`.
They can be defined in the `uiSchema` like:
> Note: Other types such as `date` or `email` cannot be updated simultaneously in a collaborative manner.

```jsx
const uiSchema = {
    textarea: {"ui:widget": "textarea"},
    uri: {"ui:widget": "uri"}
}

render((
  <CollabForm
    id="MyForm"
    collectionName="forms"
    schema={schema}
    uiSchema={uiSchema}
  />
), document.getElementById("app"));

```
>Note: `text` is the default String type.

>Note: Do not pass `formData` to `CollabForm`, the data will be fetched
from the collaboratively shared data in the database.

## Example app
Multiple example apps are present in the `demos` directory. Feel free look at
them for a real implementation of `collab-meteor`.
